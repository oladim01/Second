    <h2>To Khadeejah,</h2>
    <div>There is no one in this world except you that makes me happy when she smiles,</div>
    <div>And there's no one that makes me lost just looking in her eyes,</div>
    <br> 
    <div>For the best part of five years you were the person I had on my mind,</div>
    <div>So beautiful, so pure, so rare to find,</div>
    <br>
    <div>At that point,my heart knew that it had found something right,</div>
    <div>And I'll try my best to be good to you, with all my might, </div>
    <br>
    <div>In the long run, it wasn't meant to be</div>
    <div>But the fact that I got closer to you made me happier than happy,</div>
    <br>
    <div>You're so charming, smart, an all round topper,</div>
    <div>Deserving of more than what I had to offer,</div>
    <br>
    <div>So I'll wrap up with this, My One And Only Queen,continue to be the best that I know you to be,</div>
    <div>Cos I know you are Khadeejah, worthy for everyone to see </div>
    <br>
    <div>Happy Birthday once again Miss Khadeejah Abdullahi,and may today be one of your best birthdays you have ever had.</div>
        <br>
